                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>LEGO-MR is a concept project exploring how mixed reality can enhance the fun and collaboration of
                    building LEGO sets. In this scenario, a parent and their teenager use a mobile app and a pair of MR
                    glasses to build and interact with LEGO sets in new ways. The phone helps with set selection,
                    instructions, and pairing, while the MR headset overlays virtual guidance and step-by-step
                    simulations on top of the real world. The project was built as a visual prototype in Figma for our
                    Human-Computer Interaction course, with a focus on user-friendly interaction, creativity, and
                    accessibility.</p>

                <h2>Interaction Design Patterns</h2>
                <section id="mobile-app">
                    <h3>1.1. Mobile App</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Navigation:</strong> The app opens directly on the dashboard, which is accessible
                            through a bottom navigation bar. This ensures quick access to essential sections like Home,
                            Sets, and Profile.</li>
                        <li><strong>Layout:</strong> Horizontal carousels display LEGO sets using large images and tiles
                            for visual engagement. The layout also includes clear information panels for each set (e.g.,
                            name, overview, rating).</li>
                        <li><strong>Actions and Commands:</strong> Users interact with tap gestures to select sets and
                            navigate between pages. Standard mobile actions like swipe and tap are used throughout the
                            app.</li>
                        <li><strong>Tables and Lists:</strong> Content such as ratings and set details are displayed in
                            list-like vertical or horizontal arrangements using cards for clarity and accessibility.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Form Patterns:</strong> Any input screens (e.g., login or feedback) follow standard
                            mobile form UI with large touch-friendly inputs and on-screen keyboards.</li>
                    </ul>
                </section>

                <section id="mr-headset">
                    <h3>1.2. MR Headset</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Virtual/3D Objects:</strong> During Build mode, digital overlays highlight where
                            pieces go in the physical LEGO model.</li>
                        <li><strong>AR/Spatial Markers:</strong> The glasses track the physical LEGO blocks and guide
                            placement with AR highlights.</li>
                        <li><strong>Buttons & Menus:</strong> Simple, floating UI elements allow users to access more
                            information or quit the session during MR use.</li>
                        <li><strong>Gestures:</strong> Basic selection and navigation is imagined through head gaze or
                            hand-based triggers (depending on device capabilities), although interaction is mostly
                            visual.</li>
                        <li><strong>Text & Labels:</strong> Clear labels are shown for each brick and build step,
                            improving visibility and understanding.</li>
                        <li><strong>Audio/Sound Effects:</strong> Future improvements may include audio guidance or
                            confirmation sounds to enhance the immersive experience.</li>
                        <li><strong>Camera Controls:</strong> The MR headset passively captures and overlays content in
                            the user's environment, enhancing the build with AR.</li>
                    </ul>
                </section>

                <p>These patterns were chosen to make the LEGO experience feel natural, intuitive, and
                    magical—preserving the hands-on fun of LEGO while enhancing it through technology.</p>
            </section>

            <section id="design-decisions">
                <h2>Design Decisions</h2>
                <p>The design of LEGO-MR was heavily inspired by the playful, creative spirit of LEGO itself. We wanted
                    to make sure the app felt fun and intuitive while being functional for both kids and adults.</p>

                <section id="color-scheme">
                    <h3>2.1. Color Scheme</h3>
                    <p>We went with bright, saturated colors that reflect the joy and energy of LEGO bricks. The primary
                        red (#F93827), sunny yellow (#FFD65A), and vibrant green (#16C47F) create a playful vibe. These
                        colors are contrasted with a soft gray background (#ededed) and clean black text (#180d0c) for
                        readability.</p>
                </section>

                <section id="typography">
                    <h3>2.2. Typography</h3>
                    <p>All fonts were chosen from Google Fonts to keep things accessible and cohesive. Titles use the
                        bold and chunky <strong>Sigmar One</strong>, subtitles use <strong>Sigmar</strong>, and the body
                        text is written in <strong>Yusei Magic</strong> for a touch of whimsy without sacrificing
                        clarity.</p>
                </section>

                <section id="visual-style">
                    <h3>2.3. Iconography & Visual Style</h3>
                    <p>Icons are consistent in style and placed intuitively across the interface, ensuring quick
                        recognition and minimal learning curve. The UI is slightly rounded and minimal, letting the
                        vibrant content (like LEGO models and AR overlays) take center stage.</p>
                </section>

                <section id="transition">
                    <h3>2.4. Platform Transition</h3>
                    <p>The experience transitions smoothly between mobile and MR platforms. The phone is used for
                        browsing, selection, and setup, while the MR glasses handle immersive interaction during
                        building. We made sure the switch feels natural—users get onboarding instructions when pairing
                        the headset, and MR mode reflects the mobile layout for familiarity.</p>
                </section>

                <section id="accessibility">
                    <h3>2.5. Accessibility & Usability</h3>
                    <p>We prioritized simplicity and visibility. Buttons are large enough for young users, colors are
                        high contrast for clarity, and instructions are icon-supported where possible. The design
                        encourages exploration while keeping users oriented at all times.</p>

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>LEGO-MR was a fun and creative concept to work on, combining everyday technology like smartphones
                    with the immersive power of MR glasses. It gave us the chance to think about real-world usability,
                    accessibility, and how digital tools can enhance physical experiences. We focused on a simple and
                    intuitive user flow, keeping both kids and parents in mind. While it's not a real app (yet!), the
                    Figma prototype shows what could be possible with just a little imagination and the right tech.</p>
